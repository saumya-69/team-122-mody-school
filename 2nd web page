<br>A cochlear implant is a small electronic device that can help improve the hearing of people with severe,
<br> irreversible hearing loss. Although a cochlear implant does not restore normal hearing,
<br> it can allow a person to hear and understand more speech than was possible with a hearing aid.</p>
<p><h2>Knee problem</h2>

<br>Mild knee injuries often improve with rest, ice and anti-inflammatory medications. 
<br>Wearing a brace can stabilize your knee while it recovers. If arthritis is causing knee pain,
<br> your treatment may include medication and physical therapy.</p>

Try to limit saturated fats, foods high in sodium, and added sugars. Eat plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables, 
<br>and whole grains. The DASH diet is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol,
<br>two things that can lower your risk of heart disease. Get regular exercise.</p>
